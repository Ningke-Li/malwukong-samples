## Create a Miro app

The easiest way to get started with the Miro Developer Platform is by using
`create-miro-app`. \
To get started, run the following command:

```sh
npx create-miro-app@latest
```

To create a new app in a specific folder, you can send a name as an argument. \
For example, the following command will create a new Miro app called `my-miro-app`
in a folder with the same name:

```sh
npx create-miro-app@latest my-miro-app
```

### Options

You can append the following options to `npx create-miro-app@latest` to run the
installation in a silent, non-interactive mode.

If you don't append any options, you'll be prompted to specify app name and
package manager interactively.

| Name          | Description                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `--npm`       | Bootstraps the project using `npm`.<br />Default: `yarn`, if installed.                                     |
| `--framework` | Sets the framework template to use.<br />One of: `vanilla`, `react`, `preact`, `vue`, `nextjs` or `express` |
