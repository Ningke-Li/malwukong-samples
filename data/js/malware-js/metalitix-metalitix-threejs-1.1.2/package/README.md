# Metalitix-Threejs Logger
Three.js logger code to integrate Metalitix® into your experience. Unlock spatial analytics for your 3D scene. Learn more at [Metalitix™ - Spatial Analytics for the Metaverse](https://www.metalitix.com/) 

## Install
```sh
npm install @metalitix/metalitix-threejs
```

## Usage
> [Click here for an example project on Github.](https://github.com/Metalitix/metalitix-threejs-example)
___
1. Make sure you complete the steps on the [Getting Started](/getting-started) page. _This includes whitelisting your domain and uploading a 3D model._

2. If not already done so, create a ThreeJS project.

3. Run `npm install @metalitix/metalitix-threejs` to install the Metalitix-ThreeJS Logger.

4. Instantiate the `MetalitixLogger` by passing in the `apiKey` from your project settings found in the [Metalitix dashboard](https://app.metalitix.com/). Then, start the logger session by calling `startSession()` and passing in your camera ([`PerspectiveCamera`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/cameras/PerspectiveCamera)) and your scene ([`Object3D`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/Object3D)). Your own scene is the 3D model of the experience or the parent for your scene's models.

	The logger will automatically track camera and scene movement plus metrics such as FPS and engagement level. Because camera and scene movements are recorded, it is not necessary to manually calibrate the scene positioning in the [Metalitix dashboarsd](https://app.metalitix.com/). However, this is only the case if you specify the second `myScene` parameter. If the `myScene` parameter is not set then manual scene calibration may be necessary because only camera movement is recorded.

	```javascript
	import MetalitixLogger from '@metalitix/metalitix-threejs';
	...
	const apiKey = 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx';
	const logger = new MetalitixLogger(apiKey);
	...
	const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera();
	const myScene = new THREE.Mesh(new THREE.BoxGeometry(), new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial());
	logger.startSession(camera, myScene);
	```

5. Metalitix is now configured to gather analytics on your project! You can read about additional configuration options and interaction tracking on the [Logger Extras](/logger-extras.md) page. You can find an [example project on Github](https://github.com/Metalitix/metalitix-threejs-example).
