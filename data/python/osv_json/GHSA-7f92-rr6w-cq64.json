  "details": "### Background\nWhen attempting to use the v0.2.14 release, @pandadefi discovered an issue using the `@nonreentrant` decorator.\n\n### Impact\nReentrancy protection storage slots get allocated to the same slots as storage variables, leading to the corruption of storage variables when using the `@nonreentrant` decorator.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue was fixed in v0.2.15 in #2391, #2379\n\n### Workarounds\nDon't use the `@nonreentrant` decorator in these versions.",
